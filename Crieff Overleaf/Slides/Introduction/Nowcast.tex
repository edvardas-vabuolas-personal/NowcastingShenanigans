\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{What is nowcasting?} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prediction of the immediate past, present or future. 
        \item Typically makes use of 'high dimensional' data, in which the number of indicator variables vastly outweighs the number of observations.

     \item \textbf{What benefits does this bring?}
     \begin{itemize}
         \item  Where there is a latency in reporting or likelihood of data revision (e.g. official statistics), nowcasting offers a timely insight to key variables of interest (i.e. GDP)    
     \end{itemize}

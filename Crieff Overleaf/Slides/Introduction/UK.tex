    \frametitle{Why The UK?}
    We have chosen the UK as our country for a few reasons:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A natural interest in studying the UK economy as all three of us are permanent residents.
        \item Excellent record of macroeconomic time series provides a generous data-set for model building and out-of-sample testing.
        \item Good body of existing literature focusing on a similar research question.
    \end{enumerate}

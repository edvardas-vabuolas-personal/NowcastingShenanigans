    \framesubtitle{Why did AR and VARs become popular benchmarks?}

    AR models and VARs are commonly used as a benchmark, because:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They are easy to implement/fit
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item We can use OLS for estimation
              \end{itemize}
        \item Parameters are easily interpretable
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item Coefficients show the impact of past values to current value
              \end{itemize}
        \item They have a relatively good predictive performance
        \item They are versatile
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item AR models can accommodate seasonality, structural breaks, trends and cycles
              \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    We will use ACF to determine if (or how many times) GDP needs to be differenced.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Calculate AC for each period $k$
        \item If ACs are decreasing, then that is a sign of weak stationarity
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item This is because the effect of ${\Delta GDP}_{t-k}$ onto ${\Delta GDP}_t$ is fading as $k \to \infty$
              \end{itemize}
        \item If ACs decrease very slowly, then there is evidence for unit root, we use $\Delta {GDP}_t$ and go back to Step 1.
    \end{enumerate}

In short, LSTM is a process which maps a series of inputs to a specified output. Each indicator is assigned a weighting which tuned using training data on the basis of the combination which minimises MSPE.

LSTM has only been applied to macro forecasting in the last few years. As a result, previous literature in this context is limited. However, we propose application of the process outlined in \parencite{hopp_benchmarking_2022} who reported promising predictive gains in GDP relative to traditional approaches.

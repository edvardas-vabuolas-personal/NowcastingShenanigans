\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Flexibility in input data (i.e. able to mitigate effects of jagged edges and mixed frequency data problems).
        \item Ability to map non-linear relationships. 
        \item Minimal increase to computational demand from additional input variables. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

 \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Disadvantages:}
     \begin{itemize}
         \item Difficulty in interpretation of individual economic parameters. 
         \item Stochastic nature of LSTM means the approach should be repeated several times.  
         \item Relatively scarce body of literature to validate application in a macro prediction context, with the earliest example occurring in \parencite{kurihara_fukushima_2019}.

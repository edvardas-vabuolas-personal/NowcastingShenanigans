    \begin{itemize}
        \item There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that Machine Learning methods can bring notable predictive gains to exercises in nowcasting GDP 
        \parencite{kant}. 
        \item Such approaches are typically more efficient  than traditional approaches when analysing high dimensional data \parencite{kapetanios}. 
        \item Non-linear methods in particular (i.e Artificial Neural Networks) are suggested to reduce prediction error under the scenario macroeconomic uncertainty \parencite{coulombe}.
        \item However, these approaches are not without downsides, namely in the difficulty in interpretation of economic parameters.

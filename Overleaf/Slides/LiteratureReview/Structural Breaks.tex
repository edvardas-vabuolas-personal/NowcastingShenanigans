    \framesubtitle{What are they and why do they matter?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Phenomena in time series where significant shifts in the data result in changing relationships between parameters of regression models.
        \item Can be caused by systematic shocks (global financial crises, war and pandemics) or policy regime shifts (Brexit).
        \item Evidence of structural breaks within time series data and key macroeconomic indicators. \parencite{stock_evidence_1996}
        \item Structural breaks play a role in forecast failure. \parencite{stock_evidence_1996, andrews_forecasting_2005}
        \item Adaptive parameters can protect against this induced forecast failure. \parencite{andrews_forecasting_2005,castle_nowcasting_2009}

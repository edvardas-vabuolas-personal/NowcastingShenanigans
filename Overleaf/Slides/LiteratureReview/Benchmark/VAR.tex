        VARs extend AR models. They allow estimating and forecasting multiple time series based on their past values, and are often used to forecast macroeconomic indicators \parencite{schorfheide_real-time_2015,cambamendez_automatic_2001}.

        \cite{stock_watson} critical review concludes that VARs are "powerful and reliable tools for data description and forecasting" \parencite{stock_watson}. VARs are also a foundation to more complicated models that are used by high-level organisations today \parencite{stock_watson_2017}.

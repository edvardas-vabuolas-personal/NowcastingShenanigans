    \frametitle{Data Issues}
    Given the nature of our research topic, we are faced with two issues that are well documented in the literature:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Mixed-frequency Data:} Monthly indicators will be transformed into quarterly form. This forms the basis of the bridge equation approach to the mixed-frequency issue.
        \item \textbf{"Jagged-Edge" and Missing Data:}  Data releases are asynchronous, resulting in a jagged edge in most recent data. We will estimate/forecast missing values using a uni-variate auto-regression with white noise errors as suggested by \textcite{castle_forecasting_2017}.
    \end{enumerate}

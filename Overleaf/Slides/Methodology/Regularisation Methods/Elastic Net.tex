    \begin{itemize}
        \item The elastic net applies a convex sum of the previous two approaches, where the relative weights of each penalty are determined by an additional tuning parameter \emph{alpha} \parencite{zhou_hastie_2005}. 
        \item When using high dimensional data, this simultaneously aids in regularisation and variable selection. The correlated variable problem characteristic of the previous two approaches is also mitigated.
        \item Again, we propose \emph{gmlnet} R package to implement the method and select parameters. 
        \vspace{2mm}
        \item Literature indicates varying degrees of predictive gains across all outlined regularisation techniques. We intend to measure this through out-of-sample performance. 
    \end{itemize}

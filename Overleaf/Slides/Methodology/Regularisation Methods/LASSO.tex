\begin{itemize}
    \item LASSO is a regression technique which assists in indicator selection through application of a shrinkage penalty proportionate to size of the coefficient \parencite{Tibshirani_1996}.
    \item The resulting model is parsimonious, and thus more interpretable,  as less relevant indicators are set equal to zero. However, a documented weakness of LASSO is that it fails to perform group selection where indicators are correlated \parencite{Liu_Li_2017}. 
    \item The tuning parameter must be correctly selected so as to minimise prediction error subject to the bias-variance trade-off. For implementation, we propose use of \emph{glmnet} R package. This assists with optimal tuning parameter through in-built k-fold cross validation. 
\end{itemize}
